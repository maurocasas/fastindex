# FastIndex

FastIndex is an open-source and self-hostable search engine indexation alternative to TagParrot, URLMonitor, Omega Indexer, IndexRusher, IndexWhale and many many more...

It's built on top of Laravel 11 and Laravel Livewire to ensure speed. It protects your Google Search Console for API abuses and throttling, checks for broken links,
provides insights on sitemaps and pages, and best of all, it's completely unlimited.

Manage unlimited sites, pages, sitemaps, service accounts and users.
